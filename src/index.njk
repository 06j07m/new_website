        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>I've been working with code since 2018, and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in (Honours) Computer Science at McGill University, with minors in Statistics and Linguistics.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about using technology to help people. I hope to work on projects that are innovative and impactful, whether as a developer or as a researcher. I believe in honesty and learning through doing.</p>
        <p>When I'm not programming, you might find me jogging, watching B-list movies, reading comics, or making egg fried rice.</p>
