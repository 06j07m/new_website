<p>My primary interests lie in the intersection of language, machine learning, and computer vision. Areas that I would like to work in include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Language generation with logic constraints:</strong> generation of acrostics, mnemonics, and names with humorous or readable acronyms</li>
    <li><strong>Multimodal machine interpretation and translation:</strong> computer interpretation of sign languages</li>
    <li><strong>Language documentation and revitalization:</strong> what can technology do for endangered languages?</li>
    <li><strong>OCR:</strong> text and handwriting recognition for marginalized languages, optical music recognition</li>
</ul>

<p>I am also curious about other topics: climate change, accessibility, aviation, and forensics.</p>
